<div class="backertall">Regular Events</div>
<div class="backer">Event Roster</div>
<p>There are currently four things that are counted as "Events" in frontier, two of these are always available and two that are on a cycle. The always available events are <b>Conquests</b> and <b>Hunter's Road</b> while the two cycling events are the <b>Hunter Festival</b> and <b>Diva Defense</b>.</p>

<p>Doing all four of these events gives you access to <b>Event Cycle Equipment</b>, this is mostly outdated but the decorations can have many use cases and the weapons are still solid choices for a Level 50 G Rank weapon to unlock <b>Shiten Conquests</b>.</p>


<div class="backer">Event Cycle Equipment</div>
<p>There are three series of Weapons and three series of Armour and Decorations that come from participating in all of the running events. 40 of each event's material are needed for any single Decoration or Weapon. Armour pieces are also 40 mats but you should never need them.</p>
<p>For weapons these are the <b>Law (律法, Light Element)</b>, <b>Sage (賢者, Wind Element)</b> and <b>Truth (Darkness)</b> series. All three of these series have weapons in every category and have high elemental and sharpness but relatively low raw by modern standards.</p>
<p>Armour and Decoration wise you have the <b>Ninfa (寧芙)</b>, <b>Uiru (意志)</b> and <b>Anju (聖使)</b> series. These will never be used in terms of actual armour pieces in the current game environment but Ninfa and Uiru can be commonly needed in solid sets while Anju is less likely to be needed.</p>

<div class="backersmall">Weapons</div>
<p class="lessmargin">The Melee Weapons all have a big chunk of cyan sharpness and high hybrid elemental values.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">The Bowguns have solid raw, high affinity and maxed capacity for Normal, Pierce and the two associated elemental shots. The LBG also have rapid fire in certain shot types.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">The Bows have very high hybrid elemental values, high raw, high affinity. Charges vary by Bow element.
<br/><img class="bordered festivalimg" src="./img/blank.png" data-src="./img6/regulareventsWeapons.png" width="390" height="245" alt=" "></p>
<p class="lessmargin">There are currently three different weapon trees, one with Light Element (光屬性, 70% Fire, 70% Thunder), one with Darkness (80% Ice, 80% Dragon) and one with Wind (80% Thunder, 80% Ice).</p>
<p class="lessmargin">Each Weapon needs 40 of each of the 4 cycling materials to be fully upgraded. They do not require any other materials outside of standard conquest rewards and so are very easy to make just by playing.</p>


<div class="backersmall">Armours</div>
<p class="lessmargin">The <b>Armours</b> and their associated refined gems all have points in commonly utilised G Rank skills meaning they are useful in a wide variety of sets and can potentially be build enabling. The decorations specifically can easily add points in skills such as as <b>Combat Supremacy</b> and <b>Assistance</b>.<br/><img class="bordered festivalimg" src="./img/blank.png" data-src="./img6/regulareventsArmours.png"  width="337" height="289" alt=" "></p>

<p class="lessmargin">Each fully upgraded piece needs <b>40 of each of the 4 item types</b> to be maxed, this means at most you can get <b>two</b> maxed armour pieces, decorations or weapons each full event cycle.</p>

<div class="backer" id="18a"><img style="margin-top:2px;" src="./img/blank.png" data-src="./img6/icon_ContestSM.png" alt=""> Hunting Competition</div>
<p class="lessmargin">The Hunting Competition is an event that takes place during the sign up week that is the week prior to the Hunter Festival beginning. For the actual Hunting Competition a certain monster or set of monsters will be posted for Time Attack hunts with preset gear, these are ranked across the entire game's population with people coming in the top spots getting extra rewards. Typically as of G10 these all require you to use a G Rank Origin weapon.</p>
<p>These quests take place during set hours, they're available from 14:00 on the Friday until 14:00 on the following Monday. The quests are available on the main non-G Rank quest giver, the Guildie wearing black.</p>
<p>The quests are always in their own section for the Official Hunting Assembly (<b>官方狩獵大會</b>) and there will typically be a couple variations available. You cannot take items on these quests outside of gunning items (Ammo, Coatings) if applicable and will need to meet whatever HR or GSR requirements are in place.</p>
<p>Simple particiation rewards include materials for Pugi Cuffs (<b>鈕扣原料</b>), Cat Decorations (<b>貓珠原料</b>) and various other materials for crafting other items.</p>

<p class="lessmargin">Coming within the <b>Top 500 or higher</b> gives Artisan Tickets (<b>匠票券</b>) for equipment, White Ticket Halves (<b>半券白</b>) to take Special Quests.</p>
<p class="leftalign lessmargin"><b>Top 200:</b> grants the above plus extra Festival Points if you win the Festival.</p>
<p class="leftalign lessmargin"><b>Top 100:</b> grants the above as well as 100RP.</p>
<p class="leftalign lessmargin"><b>Top 10:</b> grants the above with 500RP instead.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">If you manage to come within the <b>Top 3</b> you will be given a vouchers to craft a special winners furniture piece and a helmet which will be Gold, Silver or Bronze depending on which spot you took.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">The Special Quests for the <b>White Ticket Halves (半券白)</b> can be found <s>in the <b>Arena (鬥技場)</b> section of the normal Black Guildie in the <b>HR1-31</b>.</s> somewhere on the Black Guild NPC. The quest gives <b>20x Mega Juice, 20x Max Potion and 10x Disposable Earplugs</b>.
</p>
<p>Outside of the hunting events there will usually be some form of Fishing competition on, this is for the largest fish of various types. Details on the fish assigned as well as any other Competition can be viewed at the Purple Festival Manager.<br/>

<div class="backer" id="18c"><img style="margin-top:2px;" src="./img/blank.png" data-src="./img6/icon_CaravanSM.png" alt=""> Caravan Festival (Pallone)</div>

<div class="newbox_shadow_red" style="margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:-5px;">
<p class="lessmargin" style="margin-top:-5px;">Carvan Festival has been replaced with the Diva Defense Event! This information is left here for historical purposes and in case it ever returns!
</p> 
</div>

<div class="backersmall">General Info</div>
<p>The Caravan or Pallone Festival is an event in which you have to complete a number of different tiered Caravan Quests. These are grouped by Star Rating similar to how the other Monster Hunter titles sort their main quests.</p>
<p><b>Caravan Quests</b> are quests in which you will need to complete a number of different objectives across multiple areas without returning to town. Some of these quests will allow you to return to a Hot Air Balloon and spend any CP you have gained during them on items, but generally most will simply be hunting between one and seven monsters in a row without restocking.</p>
<p>Completing each tier of the Caravan Quests grants rewards, and every quest taken will give you special Caravan Festival Points. These points all count towards extra rewards, the more times you do the various festival quests the more total rewards you will get.</p>
<p>Rewards directly from the Caravan Festival include things such as Money Tickets, HRP tickets, large numbers of Guild Contribution Points (Rasta Points), Equipment materials, Partnyaa Equipment materials and a lot more. It's definitely worth putting in the time to do the quests.</p>
<p>The quests themselves can simply be taken by the White Guildie in the town square, she will have new menus for the Caravan Festival week in place of the standard caravan quests menu.<br/>
<img class="festivalimg bordered" src="./img/blank.png" data-src="./img3/npctownCaravan.png" alt=" "><br/>
<img class="festivalimg notbordered" src="./img/blank.png" data-src="./img2/caravanfestimenu.png" alt=" "><br/>
</p>
<div class="backersmall">Claiming Rewards</div>
<p>There are <b>two sets of rewards</b> for the Caravan Festival. The first can be claimed <b>during the festival</b> and the rest <b>during the week following it</b>, be sure to grab all rewards you earn!<br/>
Rewards for given for Full Completion of a &#9733; level (e.g. 801 through 805), for Full completion of all &#9733; levels (requires G Rank), completion of a certain number of full circuits and for amassing certain amounts of Pts.<br/>
Pts are granted after every caravan quest with the total gained varying based on factors such as performance and equipment used on it. <b>This is separate from CP</b> and only appears during the Caravan Festival and not during normal Caravan quests. Points however, are calculated based upon CP and will be in the region of 1/5th the total CP you gathered during a Caravan Quest. <br/>
<img class="festivalimg notbordered" src="./img/blank.png" data-src="./img4/caravanpoints.png" alt=" "><br/>
You are ranked based upon your total points during a Caravan Festival, higher ranks bestow more rewards. The difference in amounts of rewards is not massive, so simply actively try to finish all Caravan Circuits that are available during the week of Festival and you will get plenty of return for your time investment.</p>

<div class="backersmall"><img class="festivalimg notbordered" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;" src="./gif/caravandot.gif" alt=" ">Caravan Gem</div>
<p class="lessmargins"><s>Caravan Festivals are great for ranking up your Caravan Gem as should be completing all of the circuits at least once (and ideally individual quests many times) if you don't want to miss out on exclusive rewards.</s></p>
<p class="lessmargins">Since G10 you no longer get Caravan Gem points from doing caravan due to the retirement of the event! Check the Caravan section for details on how this functions now.</p>
<div class="backersmall">Extra Point Items</div>
<p class="lessmargins">As with the other events there are items that you can take on quests to get extra points, these are:<br/>
Pallone Weave · Velveteen <b>(熱氣球布匹·別珍) - Adds 2500 Points</b><br/>
Pallone Weave · Calico <b>(熱氣球布匹·更紗) - Adds 5000 Points</b><br/>
Pallone Weave · Gold <b>(熱氣球布匹·錦紗) - Adds 10000 Points</b><br/></p>
<p class="lessmargins">Currently the only way to obtain these items is from levelling in Conquests, eventually the lowest tier (Velveteen) will be available for trade at the Tower Medal Store for 8 Medals.</p>


<div class="backersmall">G Finesse Weapons</div>
<p class="lessmargins">G Finesse Weapons are G Rank Weapons that have the skills Weapon Handling (Quick Sheathing) and Movement Speed +1 built into them. These weapons are either special caravan weapons or event weapons.<br/><img class="festivalimg bordered" src="./img/blank.png" data-src="./img6/gfinesseEvent.png" alt=" "><br/>Upgrading the base weapon is the same as any other weapon but upgrading to G Rank requires special <b>Caravan Boxes</b>.</p>
<p class="lessmargins">Doing G Ranked Caravan Routes will reward either <b>Caravan Secret Boxes (商隊秘箱)</b> or various <b>Named Caravan Boxes (Caravan Moon Box 商隊月箱, Caravan Flower Box 商隊花箱, etc.)</b>.</p>
<p class="lessmargins"><b>Secret Boxes</b> are required to take a number of special quests which give back <b>Named Boxes</b>, the exact box returned can be checked on the third page of their quest information.</p>
<p class="lessmargins"><b>Named Boxes</b> are specifically for upgrading a certain preset weapon to G Finesse level. The weapon upgraded varies based on the box and you will need to work out which upgrades the weapons you desire to upgrade as you would anything else.</p>
<p class="lessmargins">After upgrading a weapon to G Finesse level you will need to upgrade it as you do any G Rank weapon. These upgrades will exclusively use <b>Pallone's Wisdom (熱氣球的智慧)</b> as their upgrade material. These are books which you will naturally gain for simply finishing the caravan and for hitting various point goals. Upgrading weapons requires 3 books for a 100% upgrade and 1 book for a 60% upgrade. If you go for the minimum amount of books possible you will need <b>70 of these items</b>, as getting all gambles is unrealistic and because the upgrades still use Conquest Materials it is probably a better estimate to assume each weapon will need around <b>100 books to be maxed.</b></p>
<img class="festivalimg notbordered" src="./img/blank.png" data-src="./img6/gfinesseMaxed.png" alt=" ">
<p class="lessmargins">As well as being the best in their class in many cases G Finesse weapons grant <b>20% additional points for Breaking Parts, Gathering, Carving and Emergency Missions during Caravan or Pallone quests</b>. Coupled with their innate skills granted, this makes them both excellent general weapons and the ideal weapon to take on Caravan missions.</p>
<div class="backersmall">Premium Course Benefits</div>
<p class="lessmargins">
Being on Premium or VIP doubles the total number of points you gain in each course and quadruples the number of Colour PP you gain. For example if you had a rainbow gem and a quest would award 11,000pts and +11 in each colour without having premium, it would instead give 22,000pts and +44 in each colour with premium.

<div class="backer" id="18d">Conquests</div>
<p>Conquests are <b>G Rank</b> quests against levelled monsters. there are LV1, LV200, LV1000 and Lv9999 versions of conquest monsters. Check the G Rank section for more information on these.</p>
<!--
<div class="backer" id="18e">Sky Corridor</div>
<p>The Tower or <b>Sky Corridor</b> was a cycling event wherein you cleared randomly generated floors of a huge Tower, these floors contained various traps, monsters and pieces of treasure. Participating in the Tower was the only way to craft Tower Weapons and the only way to get Tower Armour, both of which are potentially incredibly good. This event <b>Ended with Z2's release</b> and is thus unavailable.</p>-->
<div class="backer" id="18f">Scheduled Quests</div>
<p>Every week after maintenance the Scheduled Quests change, any brand new monsters or content will generally appear as a Time Limited Quest before it enters the permanent quest rotation. Any unique event weapons or armour will also only be available through Scheduled Quests. You can check the <a href="gdoc/index.html">google doc</a> for details of any events that are currently happening, keep in mind this may not cover any less significant but still useful quests such as those for Gou Materials and it's worth checking through what's available yourself regardless.
