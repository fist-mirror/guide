<div class="backer_tall">Newer Information</div>
<p>More accurate information on the current meta, phases and communication can be found in Foxxy's guide <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=8395BE71FD283775!19162&amp;ithint=file%2cdocx&amp;app=Word&amp;authkey=!ANecor1tVZOPrO4">Here</a>.

<div class="backer_tall" id="26a">About</div>
<p>Raviente is a big snake. You hit it until it dies. Ravientes are hunted on a per server basis with a single HP pool. Despite the single HP pool the monster is still fought in groups of 4, with 2 groups maximum at HR2 and HR5 (8 Players) and 8 at G Rank (32 Players).</p>
<p>Raviente content lasts until what could be roughly classed as the current true endgame. It is what you need to do in order to get the very best of armour decorations and weapons and is one of the big time consuming grinds. You can start on the grind from HR2 but the weapons and equipment from Raviente do not realistically start to be relevant until you already have endgame level of gear.</p>

<div class="backer_tall" id="26b">Core Mechanics</div>

<div class="backer">Posting or Joining Raviente</div>
<p>Ravientes are started at <b>Kieru</b>, the same NPC that gives out Hunter Gems (also known as Pearls, Caravan Gems etc.).<br/>
<img class="bordered" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/kieuru.png" alt=""><br/>

<div class="backer">Sign Up Phase</div>
<p>Ravientes are not started as traditional hunts are, they outright require a certain number of hunters to be opted into the Raviente before it can be started.</p>

<p class="lessmargin">Ravientes are actively advertised to everyone on the current server in the top left of the screen, if there is an icon with the head of a Raviente that means someone has hosted a Raviente in the Caravan area and it is actively recruiting people. The icon will vary based upon the type of Raviente that is being posted. This also indicates the minimum number of players that will be required:</p>
<table class="centeredtable styledtable">
<tr><td style="background-color:rgb(255,120,120);font-weight:900;" colspan="2">Raviente Player Requirements</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left;font-size:125%;font-weight:900;padding:2px;"><img src="img7/ravi/raviiconHR2.html" alt="" style="margin:none;padding:none;"> HR2</td><td style="width:135px;">4 to 8 Players</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left;font-size:125%;font-weight:900;padding:2px;"><img src="img7/ravi/raviiconHR5.html" alt="" style="margin:none;padding:none;"> HR5</td><td style="width:135px;">4 to 8 Players</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left;font-size:125%;font-weight:900;padding:2px;"><img src="img7/ravi/raviiconG.png" alt="" style="margin:none;padding:none;"> G Rank</td><td style="width:135px;">24 to 32 Players</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If you join a Raviente party a clock icon is added next to the standard Raviente head icon, this indicates when the quests will automatically become available if you have at least the minimum number of players. This starts at 12 and goes to 9, if 9 is hit without the requisite player count this rolls over back to 12 and starts again. This will happen any number of times up until the Raviente actually starts or is cancelled.<br/>
Players who are members of a Raviente Party will also have a new icon <img class="notbordered" style="margin-top:-20px;margin-bottom:-5px;" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/raviplayericon.png" alt=""> replacing their Caravan Gem  </p>
<img class="notbordered" style="margin-top:-20px;margin-bottom:-5px;" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/raviclock.png" alt="">
<p>This waiting period is optional, as soon as a raviente has the minimum players the player classed as the organiser will be able to instantly start it. This is very useful for HR5 ohunts</p>

<div class="backersmall">Recruitment</div>
<p>As it's quite likely you won't have a guild with 8-24 people actively online at all times it's worth knowing how to actually advertise the Raviente either for yourself or others, pasting in the game can be finnicky and as such you should ensure you are capable of doing so, the following are all things worth trying:<br/>
<b>Copying from a browser</b>, <b>Copying from Character Map</b> or <b>Copying from Microsoft Office, LibreOffice or Apache OpenOffice</b><br/>
Any mainstream browser can work except outdated versions of internet explorer. Character map can be started by using <b>Start > Run > charmap.exe</b> and any flavour of office should work.<br/>
If you find any other consistent ways of fixing formatting to be pastable in game please contact me so I can add them.</p>

<p style="lessmargin">For actual advertising the following are all components that can be used:</p>

<p>It's not advisable to try and start G Rank ravientes as they need a significant grasp of Chinese in order to organise everyone properly.</p>

<div class="backersmall">Quests and Points</div>
<p>HR2 and HR5 Raviente both have 9 Hunting Quests and a single Carving Quest. Completing these quests and breaking parts during them will give you Contribution Points. These are what your extra Raviente Gem rewards will be based upon. The table below details the basic points you will earn for actions and the number of gems you can expect.</p>

<p class="smalltext">* The Pioneer system is covered in the Caravan section. Bond points are given from participating in the Hunter Festival at a rate of roughly 1.5x your own reward. You can stack up to 9 full Level 5 flag rewards at once to be used across 9 Ravis, this will need to be renewed after those 9 or before you do all 9.</p>
<p>Ideally for HR5 you want to get at least 2 breaks per quest and 2 support breaks to get into the 1,000,000 reward bracket with Pioneer or Bond Points additions. Failing to reach 1,000,000+ robs you of tens of 100g gems.</p>
<p>At G rank you really want to simply get absolutely everything possible in your run with 2 breaks per run  without determination and up to all four with. (Crystal > Head > Shell > Tail).</p>

<div class="backer">Hunting Phase</div>
<p>After the Raviente begins the terrain in the Caravan area will change and a new board will appear above the quests board indicating the Raviente is active. This phase lasts up to three hours and you can start posting quests and supporting from this point.<br/><img class="bordered" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/raviboardLR.png" alt=""><br/>
There are basically two main roles carried out with Ravientes these roles are either Support or Slaying.</p>
<div class="backersmall">Slaying</div>
<p>Slaying is exactly what you would expect, you join a normal raviente quest as posted from the Blonde Caravan Quest NPC and go hit it until it dies. There are <b>9 phases</b> to both HR2 and HR5 Raviente, you will visit three different islands at least three times each. Each island has different properties and environmental hazards to adapt to.</p>
<p>Something of note for those trying to break the shell is that the shell is quite literally a case around a center hitbox. If you are gunning you want to shoot either parallel along the side of Raviente or upwards towards the top of it rather than directly into it.<br/>
<img class="bordered" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/ravi_underside.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Each quest starts you in a Balloon with an NPC from which you can buy various items in exchange for CP. These items are as follows:</p>

<div class="backersmall">Support</div>
<p>For Raviente at HR2 and HR5 support roles are <b>almost completely passive</b>, your main objective is to simply deliver items to a Felyne that appears next to the Equipment Tent. These deliveries power 4 different abilities for those actively in quests. If you want to play Support it is highly recommended you have large stocks of these items in advance so you can run deliveries easier.</p>

<p>Outside of Destruction Support these support tasks <b>do not give points to your party</b>. If you have no dedicated support player it is recommended that you <b>take turns</b> with the support tasks, alternating between all hunters and giving any extra to whoever ends up the furthest behind points wise. It is poor form to try and snipe support to get your own points with no consideration for everyone else.</p>
<p>As mentioned if you end up with a 9th phase it's recommended you work out who has the least points and let them do the final support task. Otherwise simply @dice in chat and go with the highest roller.</p>


<div class="backersmall">High Level Runs</div>
<p>If you are going with a group of G Rank players it is recommended to run with a similar set up to G Rank Raviente. Have a gunner of some form (ideally LBG or HBG for consistency) focus entirely on the shell while everyone else breaks the tail. This should guarantee two breaks per round and potentially three if everyone stops attacking when the tail is broken to allow the gunner to shoot the head.</p>
<p>These type of runs should result in at least 90,000 per round. Stacked with destruction Support, the pioneer (or bond point) buff this should push you to at least 950,000. This can easily be pushed to 1,000,000 by causing extra breaks in the Carving phase or if you have an additional round.</p>


<div class="backer" id="26x" style="text-align:center;">Hitboxes</div>
<p>Raviente is basically a series of giant moving hitboxes. Raviente is unique in that his hitboxes adjust based on the elements and damage types they are taking, you will get best returns by having a balanced team and having dual elemental weapons such as Light in use.<br/>
<img src="img7/ravi/hitboxes_sm_lr.png" alt="" class="notbordered"><br/>
<img src="img7/ravi/hitboxes0.png" alt="" class="notbordered"><br/>
</p>

<div class="backersmall">Premium and Raviente</div>
<p>In terms of weapon gems all Ravientes are notably affected by Premium, they add an extra 50 stack of 100g or Gg gems in the carving phase and double all gems from Kieru after you claim additional rewards. Assuming you get 1 million points each round this means you should get 330 100g gems per HR5 Raviente compared to the usual 190. Even bad runs of Berserk Raviente will end up with 200 Gg gems with this, slightly above that you'd get from a perfect run without premium.</p>

<p>G Rank Ravientes are generally organised in a much more cohesive manner than the HR2 or HR5 version but in general they still follow the same general pattern.</p>

<div class="backer" style="text-align:center;" id="26gear">Expected Gearing</div>
<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;">Basics</div>
<p>It is expected that all members of a Raviente group have Hiden in the weapon they are using. If you don't have Hiden or even something as optimised as the cookie cutter sets in the Armour section, <b>you should not be doing G Raviente at all</b>. It would even be advisable to wait until you have multiple Hiden set ups and a good variety of Level 50 weapons to choose from before even thinking about approaching Raviente grind at all. If you are unwilling to do Hiden Grind you should simply pretend Raviente does not exist in your game and actively ignore it.</p>

<p>For actively following meta for groups without Determination you will want Hiden in Hammer, LBG, DS and/or Hunting Horn. Groups going for meta are usually obvious as they will advertise only for specific weapons. Likewise if a host is only posting <b>-3/-2/-1</b> or similar they are probably indifferent to the Hammer/HH/DS/LBG meta standards.</p>

<p><b>Groups will always be using SR Adrenaline food</b>. If you are doing Berserk Raviente you should make sure you are comfortable with Adren runs before even considering it.</p>

<p>The <b>Cycling Event Equipment</b> is excellent for Raviente as it has high Cyan Sharpness and the Light element, this means you can buff both Fire and Thunder by using Blazing Grace+2 and a Zinogre Armour piece.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:10px;">Raviente takes less damage to types dealt to it (i.e. if your group had 4 DS users it will very quickly take massively reduced damage from Cutting leading to lower chances of breaks.) and as such deally teams will want 1x Ranged, 1x Cutting, 1x Impact and 1x Hunting Horn even outside of meta.</p>

<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;">Skill Setups</div>
<p style="margin-bottom:2px;">Get all the DPS skills you can and Hiden. Vague meta for starting is still just GS, Hammer, LBG and Hunting Horn groups with variable for actual endgame groups.

<p style="margin-bottom:5px;"><b>TL;DR:</b> GS > SnS, Lance, HBG > GL, LS > Tonfas, Bow</p>
</td></tr>
</table>



<div class="backer" id="26e" style="text-align:center;">Starting Process</div>
<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;">Recruitment</div>
<div class="newbox_shadow">
<p>Do not join Ravientes or Raviente Trains that are in progress unless they have at least 4 slots and they do not actively fill up within a couple minutes.<br/>If an ongoing Ravi has 31/32 it's very likely someone disconnected and that you would be stealing a spot and you will likely find people shouting at you and angry.</p>
</div>

<p>The first phase of any Raviente is simply recruiting the 24-32 players required.</p>
<p>For Berserk Raviente you will find that pretty much all groups will actively recruit Support Teams before any hunters. This is because they are the most vital role and to avoid anyone sniping a Hunter spot in advance of actually allowing Hunter sign ups.</p>
<p>If you are wanting to join a Berserk Raviente and see that it is sitting on 4-5 players it’s almost certain that a support team is organising itself. When hunters are allowed to join whoever is organising will say something along the lines of <b>戰鬥組報名!</b> or <b>其他人都!</b> indicating that everyone not wanting to be a support should join.</p>
<p>If you cannot follow the Chinese simply look for the number increasing quickly beyond 5, busier towns will have a relatively small window to join and will fill up very fast, this is why the support teams always join first. If it is a weekend the time window can be tiny, actively monitor chat and be ready in the menu if you intend to join weekend Ravi trains.</p>


<div class="backer_tall" id="26f" style="text-align:center;">Roles</div>
<p>There are two main roles for Raviente, Supporters and Hunters. Parties will almost always want 4 Support members with everyone else being Hunters.</p>
<p>It is generally not recommended to try and be a Supporter because of the level of communication required with the organiser and the simple fact it is incredibly important that it is done correctly to allow the hunt to go by faster.</p>

<div class="backer" style="text-align:center;">Supporters</div>
<p>Supporters are responsible for keeping on top of Raviente’s rage, triggering special part destructions and providing carts for the Hunter group. </p>
<p>Efficiency at this role is very important. Whenever Ravi enters rage mode it lowers the weakness value of all hitboxes by 10, this is enough to push some hitboxes outside of exploit weakness territory and is generally speaking one of the biggest losses of DPS you can have short of missing a member. This means you almost always want a team that is on top of Sedating Ravi.</p>
<p>Likewise, Resurrection support and Destruction support need proper management to allow hunters to cart without failing the quest and to add to the point pool for all hunters.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, you will want to leave this role to native speakers as it requires that you coordinate with the actual organiser of the Raviente. Regardless, a guide to Support will be authored later.</p>

<div class="backer" style="text-align:center;">Hunters</div>
<p>For the Hunters there is a generally accepted optimal set up that is preferred by most parties, this is <b>1x Hunting Horn, 1x Impact, 1x Cutting and 1x Shot weapon</b>. The generally accepted best set is HH, Hammer, Dual Swords and a Light Bowgun, but a Great Sword can work fine as the cutting weapon and HBG have their own niche.</p>
<p>This set up is preferred because as you damage Raviente with any type of damage, it will gradually build up a resistance to it. This means you do not want to have a party of all four of one type or you will simply end up with massively reduced damage output over time.</p>
<p>As mentioned, most parties prefer Hammer, Dual Swords or Great Sword and a Light Bowgun. These are simply the best choices for a normal party in terms of DPS and guaranteeing maximum points from part and crystal breaks.</p>
<p>Another party type that has a niche is that of four Heavy Bowguns. These are typically used to spam compressed Elemental Shots. As these do next to no actual shot damage meaning the usual downside of stacked weapons do not apply, it is common to see HBG users go in parties of four. These parties have a notable downside in that you will almost certainly never get Crystal breaks and will miss out on points because of it.</p>
<p>Other party set ups can obviously clear the quests without issue but if you are playing with randoms they will most likely be adhering to the above guidelines, even if they are using other weapon types.</p>
<p>No matter how much you might like Tonfas, they are not actually valid replacements for a HH or Hammer user in terms of KO output or sheer added dps.</p>


<div class="backer" id="26i" style="text-align:center;">Preparation Time</div>
<p>After the Raviente has recruited enough people to start, the host will usually start it to allow Support to get started while everyone else organises themselves. Any Hunter teams that are already organised will likely group and and any that have not will likely be actively recruiting. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, <b>LBG users will be the ones hosting parties</b> and are responsible for keeping their team on point and by extension recruiting other players.</p>
<p>If you are hosting you can advertise spots for the type of hunters you are recruiting with -1 followed by 笛 (HH) 斬 (Cutting) 打 (Impact) or 彈 (Shot). You can also use a format such as 已有一斬一打一彈 (Already have 1 Cutting, 1 Impact, 1 Shot) to indicate how many of an existing damage type you have. You can also specifically state what weapons you desire by saying 戰組缺 1笛／弩 (Hunting group missing 1 HH, 1 Bowgun). If you are posting adrenaline you should also note 火飯 in the recruitment message because it is not always a given despite it being more common than not.</p>
<p>Naturally you can mix and match all of these to get the ideal messages desired.</p>
<p>If you are a stray hunter and just want to find a group you should send something like ‘雙劍求組’ (DS 雙劍 Seeking Group 求組) or ‘大錘或笛求組’ (Hammer or HH seeking group) etc.</p>
<p>After the support team has carried out their job all the Hunting Teams may start entering. You will know when to enter by either the +40000 points message that will appear or a member of Raviente group asking hunting teams to enter.</p>


<div class="backer_tall" id="26j" style="text-align:center;">Hunting Phases</div>
<div class="newbox_shadow_blue">
<p>Realistically you are unlikely to get more than three breaks in a G Raviente without already having Determination. This is not much of an issue when grinding out Decorations but makes weapon grind slower. If you never get additional Gg Gems you will need to fight roughly 80 additional Ravientes per Lv100 weapon.</p>
</div>


<p>The actual hunting of Berserk Raviente is broken up into five different phases, these all take place in the same arena that is consistently damaged by Raviente across the five causing it to morph from an underground volcano into a lava filled wreck gaining new attacks as it goes on.</p>

<div class="backer" style="text-align:center;">Breaks</div>
<p>The biggest factor for each of the five phases is simply the number of breaks you can get per round, there are 4 breaks you can get each round. <b>Shell</b>, <b>Tail</b>, <b>Head</b> and <b>Crystal</b>. All of these breaks will pop up a +20,000 contribution point message on being destroyed. This appears <b>notably earlier</b> for the current arena host and as such if you are that person you should <b>signal when a break happens</b> so people can swap target as appropriate.</p>
<p>Generally speaking it's obvious what breaks but if you are in a party that has a split focus and are unsure you can check the below references for break visuals, all breaks cause some frills to end up tattered:</p>
<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;">Shell</div>
<p class="lessmargin">Located just as the shell starts on Ravi's back, a decent distance from his head.<br/>
<img src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/broken/shell0.png" class="bordered" alt="">
<img src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/broken/shell1.png" class="bordered" alt=""></p>

<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;">Head</div>
<p class="lessmargin">Basically Ravi's ears, located directly behind his jawline.<br/>
<img src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/broken/head0.png" class="bordered" alt="">
<img src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/broken/head1.png" class="bordered" alt=""></p>

<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;">Tail</div>
<p class="lessmargin">Located at the very tip of his tail and fairly obvious.<br/>
<img src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/broken/tail0.png" class="bordered" alt="">
<img src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/broken/tail1.png" class="bordered" alt=""></p>


<div class="backer" style="text-align:center;">Weapon Conduct</div>
<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;"><img src="img8/lbg.png" alt="" style="margin-top:-5px;margin-bottom:-7px;"> LBG</div>
<p>Bowguns should focus entirely on the shell from the second Raviente enters the arena until the moment that it breaks. Don’t bother trying to contribute towards the breaking of crystals. If you are the area host as is typical you should always signal whenever you see a +20,000 points message (excluding the crystal staggers) to allow people to move around most efficiently and avoid wasting their DPS on broken parts.</p>
<p>It's best to shoot along the length of Ravi's shell as the center of its body is the Belly hitbox and does not contribute towards breaking the shell.<br/>
<img class="bordered" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/ravi_underside.png" alt="">
</p>


<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;"><img src="img8/hh.png" alt="" style="margin-top:-5px;margin-bottom:-7px;"> Hunting Horn</div>
<p>Ideally bring a HH with Paralysis Immune, Attack Up Large and Infinite Stamina. Buff people, hit the parts that need to be hit and contribute to KOing on head. Whenever ravi does the circling attack you should trigger Paralysis Immune and Infinite Stamina if possible. It's also good to beat on the Crystals if you are in a group composition that allows you to do so.</p>

<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;"><img src="img8/ds.png" alt="" style="margin-top:-5px;margin-bottom:-7px;"> Dual Swords</div>
<p>Focus on shredding the shell and tail when needed while keeping on top of sharpen chains for DPS. Bring plenty of whetstones. Pretty hard to manage and play well if you’re using a proper set up with Combat Supremacy.</p>

<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;"><img src="img8/hammer.png" alt="" style="margin-top:-5px;margin-bottom:-7px;"><img src="img8/gs.png" alt="" style="margin-top:-5px;margin-bottom:-7px;">  Hammer / Greatsword</div>
<p>As Ravi enters by circling around the arena, he creates a ramp in the middle-left area of the map indicated by rapidly exploding rocks. You can use this ramp to climb onto Raviente’s back. On its back you will notice there is a Green/Yellow crystal that erupts with paralysis every 20 seconds or so, these are the priority target for all the hard hitting group members (HH, Hammer, GS). Breaking these crystals grants you +20,000 points and will stagger Raviente for a significant amount of time.<br/>
<img class="bordered" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/crystal.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you manage to stagger Raviente you should immediately move to its head as it falls, this is where Hammers and HH are their most important as they allow you to get a KO on Raviente that causes it to immediately repeat the stagger. You should also break the head while attacking it for this KO (+20,000) which means it’s time to move back to the Shell or onto the Tail if it’s already broken.</p>

<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;"><img src="img8/hbg.png" alt="" style="margin-top:-5px;margin-bottom:-7px;"> Heavy Bowguns</div>
<p>The meta for Heavy Bowguns is to simply spam compressed Elemental Shots. This means you deal next to no shot damage and as such your group composition does not matter and HBG users will often all go together. <b>These groups are generally banned in the serious player servers</b>, 7 HBG users performing meta can tear through a Raviente in around 17 minutes, this robs most teams of most breaks.</p>

<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;"><img src="img8/lance.png" alt="" style="margin-top:-5px;margin-bottom:-7px;"><img src="img8/gl.png" alt="" style="margin-top:-5px;margin-bottom:-7px;"><img src="img8/bow.png" alt="" style="margin-top:-5px;margin-bottom:-7px;"> Others <img src="img8/tonfa.png" alt="" style="margin-top:-5px;margin-bottom:-7px;"><img src="img8/sns.png" alt="" style="margin-top:-5px;margin-bottom:-7px;"><img src="img8/ls.png" alt="" style="margin-top:-5px;margin-bottom:-7px;"></div>
<p>Other weapons are mainly a case of emulating their closest equivalent weapon as listed above. SnS you want to get as much elemental on as possible but are functionally a worse DS. Bow is somewhere between HBG and LBG but far less effective than either because it can't use Combat Supremacy. LS, Lances and Gunlances are simply mediocre in general and lack the burst damage of GS or Hammer and the DPS of DS. Tonfas lack the burst damage and high KO of a Hammer and the party wide buffs of a Hunting Horn making them overall the weakest impact choice.</p>

<div class="backer" style="text-align:center;">Phase Notes</div>
<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;">Phase 1</div>
<p>For the first phase Ravi always starts with his spiral around the arena leaving the crystal vulnerable pretty much immediately, hard hitting weapon users should instantly climb on and break it when it is safe to do so.</p>

<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;">Phase 2</div>
<p>Raviente always emerges from the ground just above the center pool of water causing tremor. This can be evaded to fill Thunder Clad meters and followed up with a dive into Raviente's body to get a second fill. Both of these actions will also process Stylish Assault if applicable.</p>

<p>Following emerging Raviente will get into his rest position and then hit his tail against the arena, this causes water geysers to erupt across the arena followed by the entire arena exploding and being covered in water balls which will home on anyone still in the arena. The eruption will launch you and cause Raviente to eat you. This bypasses all forms of one shot prevention and cannot be avoided. It is common to Farcast out after the first geysers start or the eruption to be in a position to attack Ravi's shell after he lands from the eating animation.</p>

<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;">Phase 3</div>
<p>Raviente starts already coiled around the arena and immediately uses Explosive Powder starting from under his head and launches the usual fireballs that accompany this. You can evade both the powder explosions and fireballs to get Thunder Clad and Stylish Assault charges.</p>
<p>From Phase 3 Ravi gains the ability to slam his head into the ground, this causes AOE around it. If it is charged for a long time it is a single hit but if he does it quickly it causes multiple pellets to erupt outwards and can kill you through chip damage. You should always dive this.</p>


<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;">Phase 4</div>
<p>Raviente always emerges from the ground just above the center pool of water causing tremor, this is identical to phase 2 and still fills meters and procs evasion based skills. Following the emerging Ravi will flood the arena with lava by lifting itself up and slamming it down. This is avoidable by simply standing on any of the craters filled with water and does not do anything to stop Projectiles for gunners. You can evade into this lava as it disappears to process any evasion based skills, just as with tremor.</p>
<p>From this phase onwards Ravi can hit the arena with his tail to cause Lava Balls to rain down, these are the same as in the next phase's intro and cause Damage Over Time upon hit. Spriting full speed with Absolute Defense active avoids them killing you and Small Barrel Bombs can be used to launch yourself clear past them.</p>

<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;">Phase 5</div>
<p>Phase 5 is a copy of Phase 2's intro, you can evade it erupting to trigger evasion based skills. All attacks that were water themed are now lava based. The big change is that unlike the water balls that rain down after the arena explodes, the Lava Balls do Damage Over Time. These can be tanked with Absolute Defense if you are running full speed and will not kill you. If you are using determination the best method of evading them is to use Small Barrel Bombs to launch yourself and abuse iframes.</p>
<p>Unlike the other phases when Ravi coils around the arena and can be climbed, he will start forming a giant ball of fire. If allowed to complete this he will raise it up and drop it into the arena killing anyone who is not at the map edge behind its tail tip. Generally while it does this you will want to <b>attack the head</b> to aid Support in breaking it completely and to net yourself points for breaking it.</p>
<p>During this phase the Crystal is literally on top of Ravi's head and breaking it will cancel the giant ball of lava.</p>
<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;">Crystal Notes</div>
<p>The crystal on Ravi’s back moves further along the back of Raviente each phase. This means you have to both go further and have more efficient DPS each time to manage these breaks. During the final phase the Crystal is literally on top of Ravi’s head and if you fail to stagger him, he will drop a giant ball of flame into the arena nuking it. You can avoid this by either farcasting or simply hiding behind the tip of its tail on the map edge.</p>
<p>The final crystal is weaker than the others, in the downtime while Ravi circles the arena you should always use Dash or Mega Dash Juice and a Movement Speed Seed (CP, Caravan Store) to reach crystals quickly.</p>



<div class="backersmall" style="text-align:center;">Points Notes</div>
<p>Standard phases earn you 50,000 per clear and 20,000 per break. This includes the crystal on Raviente's back meaning you should be getting at up to 130,000 per standard run with 90,000 being the baseline 'good' value. Each break by a Support squad also grants 40,000 and the usual 50,000 Pioneer Flag (or Bond Points) bonus applies at the end of the entire set of hunts as it does for HR2 or HR5 ones.</p>
<p>You will always earn at least 500,000 points if you actually go on all Quests during a Raviente. It is incredibly uncommon to reach 800,000 or higher unless you have a group using Determination. This has almost no notable effect on the grind for Armour but does mean that you will only get 50-60 extra 100Gg gems per Raviente before you have the skill and can be part of such a group.</p>



<div class="backer" id="26y" style="text-align:center;">Hitboxes</div>
<p>Raviente is basically a series of giant moving hitboxes. Raviente is unique in that his hitboxes adjust based on the elements and damage types they are taking, you will get best returns by having a balanced team and having dual elemental weapons such as Light in use.<br/>

<p class="events blueevent" style="margin-bottom:2px;">It's quite likely that Support teams will only want properly geared people who speak chinese. Keep this in mind before you piss everyone off by not responding to people telling you to cancel the quest.</p>
<p>The <b>Support Role</b> for Berserk Raviente is done by a group actively in a quest. This involves active gathering and mining. As such if you want to perform the support roles for G rank Raviente you should have the following skills on a set:</p>

<div class="backer" id="26z">Carving Phase</div>
<div class="newbox_shadow_blue">
<p>Always join full teams for the carving phase! You get more rewards this way!</p>
</div>
<p>After a Raviente is actually dead you'll be able to sign a new quest, this is the <b>Carving Phase</b>, this can be posted within 24 hours of the Raviente starting. </p>
<p>Carving quests are exactly what they sound like, you have <b>three minutes</b> in which to carve Raviente's corpse. Each version of raviente has its own unique items, HR2 and HR5 share most of their items but HR5 has its own unique low% carve and higher rates on the items that are rare on the HR2 carve table.</p>
<p>Naturally to get the most out of this incredibly small time period you will want to get skills to maximise your returns, the following are all commonly utilised skills:</p>
<table class="ravitableskills centeredtable" style="margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:-5px;">

</table>

<p>For G Rank Raviente getting a set with <b>all of the above skills is highly recommended</b>, you need several thousand of the core mats for any Ravi set and you really want to maximise the returns from every single one you slay.<br/>
<a href="../i.imgur.com/rTSliTo.png"><img class="bordered" style="margin-bottom:0px;padding:0px;" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img7/ravi/ravicarvesThumb.png" alt=""></a>
<br/>
After you have completed the actual carving quest you should talk to Kieru again and choose the second option, this will grab your rewards and allow you to join any future quests. You cannot join another Raviente until you do this.
</p>

<div class="backersmall">Additional Breaks</div> 
<p>Despite the Raviente being dead you can  still break all of its parts during a carving quest, this is somewhat glitchy and <b>should be carried out by the host of the carving quest</b>. Simply attack all the parts until you get the +20,000 message with something like GS charges and then farcast back to the balloon to trigger the breaks for party members. This will grant everyone an additional 60,000 points making it easier to reach the million reward threshold.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you need to have pretty high damage output to manage this, an endgame G Rank GS set with Hiden and Combat Supremacy does it easily within 2 minutes, but other lesser sets likely won't.</p>
 
 <div class="backer_tall" id="26k">Raviente Weapons</div>
<div class="backer">Basics</div>
<p>Raviente weapons all start from a common source which is crafted with HR2 Raviente materials. These bases can upgraded into of three different HR5 upgrades which then in turn can all be upgraded into any of a <b>final weapon</b>. This means that before the G Rank upgrade your choices don't really matter but when you start a G Rank weapon you are locked to that single weapon, <b>you cannot change your mind later</b>. Choose your final upgrade wisely.</p>

<div class="backersmall">Upgrading</div>
<p>Unlike standard weapons Evolution or Raviente weapons have levels and make use of <b>g or Gg points</b> to be upgraded. These points are obtained by converting the varioustypes of gems you get across the types of Raviente in teh game. Three gems come from HR2 and HR5 which can only be used to upgrade pre-G Rank weapons and three others come from G Rank which can be used for both G Rank and Non-G equipment upgrades.</p>

<div class="backersmall">Final Weapons</div>
<p>As all of the weapons have 4 different final upgrades and because these are Different in different ways per weapon type it's very important you check what the final stats are on a site like Ferias.</p>
<p>For example Greatsword has Raw, Elemental, Balanced and Affinity focused weapons. Number wise the Raw version ends up better than the Affinity version - even utilising Critical Conversion - but it has the notable disadvantage of only being <b>Normal Length</b> while the Affinity Focused one is <b>Very Long</b>. This means in a large number of situations the Affinity focused weapon will end up better simply because of the advantages offered by the Length.</p>
<p>Similar situations occur with all weapons so it's important you think about what skills you will be using and how you will actually be fighting things with those weapons</p>
<p>In terms of actual usability, most of these weapons start to surpass normal G Lv50 weapons in terms of raw around the G Lv70 point and come Lv100 they have the single highest Raw values available on any weapons.</p>


 
<div class="backer_tall" id="26l">Raviente Armour</div>
<div class="backer">Basics</div>
<p>There are three different varieties of Raviente armour, one per tier of Raviente (HR2, HR5, G Rank). All three of these sets upgrade to GX level and can then be converted into G Rank decorations to be used on any set. The main reason to make these armours is is to get the skill <b>Determination</b>, an incredibly powerful hybrid skill that opens up half a dozen armour skill slots enabling sets that are outright impossible to ever create without it.</p>
<p>You can see the skills each piece has at their max G Rank level below alonm with the associated decorations that come from these pieces. The HR5 armours are not worth crafting for new players due to the grind involved and the simple fact they are not very good. Things like Zinogre, Brachy and Gou pieces have far nicer skill points for much less overall work.</p>
<div class="backersmall">Grind Scale</div>
<p>A set of Raviente Armour is one of the biggest time investments in the game currently and you will need somewhere in the region of <b>400 Berserk Raviente runs</b> to complete each set of them, which will average around 30-45 minutes each with a good group. Premium helps largely with Weapon upgrade gems and materials for marginally but not a huge amount.</p>
<p>The biggest issue with this is that because of the 24 player requirement you will need to be active during normal TW hours to hunt these Berserk Ravientes. Raviente groups can run at any time and were previously common from around 13:00 to 18:00 and 19:00 until 01:00 each day.</p>
<p>As Raviente grind is around 250 Ravis minimum, you will still take around <b>1 month to finish a single decoration set</b> even if you manage to get every into most Ravis running. No lifing the grind if trains are available will let you get a set out in around <b>15~ days</b>.</p>
<p>This is one of the longer term undertakings you can start on Frontier but considering you can remove Attack, Issen, Expert, Exploit Weakness, Elemental Exploit, Blazing Grace and Absolute Defense from any set utilising Determination this it certainly pays off in the long term. Likewise Raviente weapons outside of LBG and HBG have around 50-100 more True Raw than the next comparable equivalents.</p>

<div class="backer_tall" id="26determin">Determination</div>
<p class="lessmargin"><b>Determination</b> is a skill exclusively found on Raviente Armours and Decorations and is the <b>single strongest skill</b> in the game.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">The skill grants Attack +100, Affinity +100%, Critical Multiplier 1.5x, Adrenaline +2, Sharpness+1, Critical Shot and Exploit Weakness and Elemental Exploiter without any hitbox requirements.</p>
<p>The lack of requirements on the Exploit Weakness and Elemental Exploit are incredibly strong, this enables you to actually force an element to do damage to a monster that would otherwise be immune to it as well as simply deal more damage when hitting absolutely any spot on a monster.</p>
<p>The downside of this skill is that it disables all the usual one shot protections you could use Guts, Great Guts, True Guts, Absolute Defense, Guts Tickets, Mega Guts Tickets and Soul Revival are all disabled. Divine Protection however still functions.</p>
<p>Functionally this skill allows you to drop the following skills if used: <b>Issen, Expert, Exploit Weakness, Compensation, Edgemaster, Any source of Adrenaline+2, Any lesser attack skill, Critical Shot or Precision=2, Dissolver</b>. Some set ups will allow you to drop more or less skills, you will want Evasion+2 from somewhere if you are dropping Compensation, this can be gained from Encourage+2 in parties but solo you will need another source. Gunlances will still want to make use of Blazing Grace if shelling or using Wyvern Fire.</p>
<p>The additional 100% affinity and 1.5x Critical Multiplier is a massive buff. Despite the obvious synergy you may not want to grab Critical Conversion as newer skills will provide more DPS than the added raw.</p>



<div class="backer_tall" id="26extreme">Extreme Raviente</div>
<p>Extreme Raviente is Z2.3 filler content. It adds a second set of Berserk Raviente armour with ten new decorations and expands the grind on (most) evolution weapons by adding another 100 levels pushing them to Z100 and 400 levels total. These weapons all gain <b>Skill Slots Up+1</b> but they do not in fact gain the Part Breaker effect of other Zenith Weapons.</p>


<div class="backer" style="margin-top:10px;">Fight Changes</div>
<p class="lessmargin">They gave it more health.<br/>No, seriously, <b>that's the only thing they changed.</b></p>

<div class="backer" style="margin-top:10px;">Rewards Changes</div>
<p class="lessmargin">You get up to 450 Gg gems for a perfect raviente up from 140. 80x Extra Gg gems from the bonfire NPC up from 50x. There are two new low% gem carves and existing carves come in stacks relative to rarity (2x rares to 6x commons).</p>
<p class="lessmargin">Functionally, it takes longer but you get at least three times the rewards of a standard Raviente for perfect play and even trash play will get you more than a normal Berserk Raviente.</p>
<p class="moremargin">This is before the introduction of 4-8P Berserks so efficiency might vary in future.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">For the actual grindscale, finished Z100 weapons require 479,250 gems. Assuming nothing but perfect ravientes while actively running premium this is 453 Extreme Ravientes. You should expect this to be pretty much 700 hours of your life if you want to grind without throwing money into a burning trash fire of an endgame.</p>
