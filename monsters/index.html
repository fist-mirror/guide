<div class="backer" id="19d">Unique Mechanics</div>
<div class="backersmall">Akura Vashimu and Jebia Tails</div>
<p class="lessmargin">
<img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/akuravashimu.html"> <img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/akurajebia.html"><br/>
Akura Vashimu and Jebia both have specific requirements to cut their tails and in the case of Jebia, to get their Tail Crystal Stub to appear.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">
First you need to deal <b>Impact Damage</b> to their claws and heads, this will break the individual crystals on each section.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">
Second you need to deal <b>Cutting Damage</b> to the now broken crystals, this will cause the monster to flip over and lie on its back.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">
For <b>Akura Vashimu</b> you can cut the tail as soon as it flips the third time, simply deal cutting damage to the tail.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">
For <b>Akura Jebia</b> you will need to deal additional <b>Impact Damage</b> to the tail, this will eventually cause <b>red veins</b> to become visible, at this point you should deal <b>cutting damage</b> and you can sever the tail.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">
With the tail severed you will get one carve from the tail itself and an additional carve from the tail's crystal, assuming it was not broken.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">
After cutting the tail, both monsters will eventually try and eat their own tail to recover HP, if they are successful this will <b>remove the tail and cost you all carves on it</b>.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">
Additionally, <b>Akura Jebia</b> will grow spikes on its body where the tail is severed, breaking these crystals will grant extra rewards. Breaking them is simply a case of waiting for the monster to attempt to eat its own tail and then spamming bounce bombs underneath it.</p>

<div class="backersmall">Unknown Invasion (Black Ian)</div>
<img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/unknown.html">
<p class="lessmargin">There is a chance that after clearing normal non-gathering quests that your next quest will be invaded by an Unknown (Black Rathian), this will force everyone into the base camp and after a few seconds an 'UNKNOWN' banner will appear. This will replaces the originally posted quest and it will give materials related to Unknown instead of whatever the original quest rewards may have been.</p>
<img alt=" " class="monstersimg bordered" src="img4/unknowninvasion.html">
<p class="lessmargin">If Unknown invades an HR3-4 quest you can only Repel Unknown and it has one fewer rage phase. On invaded HR5 quests, you can actually Slay Unknown and it gains an extra rage phase, this also enables you to cut its tail which is impossible in lower rank quests.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">The invasion Unknown is weaker than the Supremacy version you can fight at SR300 and provides the same materials. Farming the lower rank version is difficult as it follows a pattern that is not public, attempting to do so is probably not wise.</p>
<p>There is a G Rank Heavenly Conquest version of Unknown, this is a set quest and does not invade any other quests. This final version of Unknown has even more moves and rage phases than the normal and supremacy versions. As a conquest it is always set to the maximum level of 9999 meaning it always has its maximum possible defence and damage output. To fight this you must be at G Rank and have made at least one Level 50 G Rank weapon.</p>
<div class="backersmall">Taikun Zamuza</div>
<p class="lessmargin"><img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/taikunzamuza.html"><br/>
Taikun Zamuza is a Carapaceon that starts its fight covered in a layer of rocks, you can cause the monster to break down into the scond layer of its cave by removing all of the rocks coating its body.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">While on the second layer you may break all the parts of Zamuza's body and you will progress to a third layer.</p>
<p>All layers of the cave contain separate mining spots and the rewards you get from the monster depend on the layer you have reached, it's incredibly hard to progress through all three floors on the lower ranked versions of this monster as it simply dies before it takes enough damage to break all parts.</p>
<div class="backersmall">Gogomoa</div>
<p class="lessmargin"><img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/gogomoa.html"><br/>
All Adult Gogomoas carry a baby on their back. If you manage to cause the Baby to fall off and deal enough damage to it, the Adult Gogomoa will go into a rage mode. While in rage mode Gogomoa gains an aura and starts to attack much faster, this also causes it to take far more damage hunters. This allows you to kill it much faster at the price of increasing the difficulty of the fight. If the adult Gogomoa changes zones after entering the rage mode it will reunite with its baby.</p>
<p>If you attack the webbing itself during the various attacks utilising it, you can cause the Adult Gogomoa to stagger and fall over. Correctly timing attacks on the monster itself while the Gogomoa uses its webbing can cause a violent explosive reaction, indicated by a huge orange flash. This reaction deals heavy damage to the monster and can knock it out of the air or stagger it.
</p>
<div class="backersmall">Espinas</div>
<p class="lessmargin"><img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/espinas.html">
<img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/espinaswhite.html">
<img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/espinasorange.html"><br/>
All versions of Espinas have a unique method of being enraged. They will always start off placid and with high defenses against all damage types, after enough damage has been dealt they will enter an enraged state where they will actively attack the Hunters but during which they can be attacked more freely due to them taking more damage and causing less weapon bouncing.</p>
<p>All versions of Espinas can have their Horns broken and Tails cut, this can only be done while the monster is on low health. Focusing on the tail after the horn breaks or vice versa is a good way of guaranteeing you manage to get the rewards for both parts.
</p>
<div class="backersmall">Pariapuria</div>
<p class="lessmargin"><img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/pariapuria.html"><br/>
Pariapuria is a fish-like monster resembling a Tigrex. It has a unique gimmick in that it will eat any meats placed in front of it while it does a specific charge. By matching the <b>colour of its drool</b> with the correct type of meat (Raw, Drugged, Paralysis and Poison) during these charges, you can cause the monster to become bloated and start to vomit. This vomit leaves piles of stone like materials which can be gathered from.</p>
<p>Some items are only obtained from causing Paria to vomit and some rare items can be found more commonly in the vomit piles than in other locations. All items gathered are additional to those given in rewards or gained from carves, some quests will also grant extra rewards for causing paria to vomit.
</p>
<div class="backersmall">Zerureusu</div>
<p class="lessmargin"><img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/zerureusu.html"><br/>
Zerureusu or White Los has a special ability known as Adaptation, this allows it to adjust its body based on the type of damage it is taking the most of. For example if it is taking mostly impact damage, it will harden its head with crystals greatly reducing impact's effectiveness there. Likewise Shot damage will cause it to harden its wings and Cutting damage will cause it to harden its tail and legs.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">Zerureusu will also use different attacks depending on the adaptation mode it is in, these are oriented around the Hitboxes that are adjusted. As an example while in Impact mode, Zeru can initiate a counter move, if too much damage is dealt to the head while it is in this counter stance it will violently retaliate against everything surrounding it.</p>
<p>Gou (HR5) Zerureusu will only start entering adaptation mode while on roughly 33% HP whereas G Rank Zeru will almost immediately start countering all damage types dealt to him.</p>
<div class="backersmall">Garuba Daora</div>
<p class="lessmargin">
<img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/garubadaora.html"> <br/>
Garuba Daora is fought on an airship and is notable in that it can do a <b>massive AOE attack that can instantly cart an entire party</b>.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">
This attack has a rather obvious tell in that Garuba will hop backwards while the various crystal coated parts of its glow. After the hop it will swipe the air in front of it and generate a spherical shield around itself, being inside this shield is the <b>only safe spot in the arena</b>.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">
Being outside of the shield will cause an incredibly fast damage over time effect that will likely instantly kill you. When Garuba does this attack as its opening, it will not actually do the backhop and will just instantly swipe the air and cause the shield and aoe effect.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">It's entirely possible to avoid the attack with a superman dive but it is incredibly easy to screw up resulting in death after your iframes expire.</p>

<div class="backersmall">Red Rajang / Phantom Dora</div>
<img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/rajang.html"><img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/doragyurosu.html">
<p class="lessmargin">Posting HC HR5 or G Rank Rajang in the Volcano or HC HR5 Doragyurosu in the Snowy Mountains has a very low chance to have the monster replaced with either a Red Rajang or Phantom Dora. Red Rajang gains the ability to summon a large ball of energy that it launches at the ground exploded in a wide area, reminiscent of a Spirit Bomb. Phantom Doragyurosu is a version of Dora that will die once and then come back to life super powered.</p>
<p>Neither of these monsters actually give different materials to their normal equivalents but you will get a vanity item to show you have hunted one if you manage to find and kill one.</p>
<div class="backersmall">Aruganosu and Goruganosu</div>
<p class="lessmargin"><img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/questionmark.html"> <img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/questionmark.html"><br/>
The supremacy monsters Aruganosu and Goruganosu (or Gold and Silver Lavasioth) are fought together in the Tower arena, they are unique in that they cannot be killed until both of the pair are at 1hp.</p>
<p>When one of the two is damaged enough to reach 1HP it will begin doing a constantly flopping animation. If you take too long in lowering the health of the second of the pair it will burrow under the injured one and launch it into the air, both reviving it and healing it somewhat. It is important to balance damage while fighting the duo or else you may find yourself only repelling due to the revivals.
</p>
<div class="backersmall">Mi Ru (Unknown)</div>
<img alt=" " class="monstersimg" src="img/mons/miru.html">
<p class="lessmargin">Mi Ru is a G Rank monster and will appear as a randomly assigned urgent quest that is given after hunting normal G Rank monsters. The urgent quest will appear in its own section containing nothing but the Mi Ru. Finishing a Mi Ru urgent quest in any way will remove the urgent quest from your list, this means you only get the one attempt and need to be sure to have a proper item set and the right gear equipped. You can of course simply fight more normal monsters if you wipe to try again at another point.</p>
