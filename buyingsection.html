<div class="backer" id="09l">Store Basics</div>
<p class="lessmargin">Like many games and services Monster Hunter Frontier uses a Point system, these are commonly referred to as either simply Points or MH Coins. 100 Points or Coins is the direct equivalent of 100 Taiwan Dollars which converts to around $3.15/€2.80/£2.40 (as of August 2016).</p>
<p class="lessmargin">Using the store is simply a case of using your preferred method to add the store's currency and then purchasing whatever you want from the individual pages of the various items and subs on sale.</p>

<div class="backersmall">MyCard Points Codes</div>
<p class="lessmargin">You can buy MyCard Points Codes from various sites, the following sites stock MyCard Codes:</p>
<p class="lessmargin">
<a href="https://www.offgamers.com/game-card/universal-game-cards/mycard-points-my-tw-sea"><b>OffGamers</b></a>
<br/>OffGamers are officially supported by MHF TW and have even had promotions previously where you get in game items for buying their MyCard codes. OffGamers has a ranking system which causes prices to go down as you buy codes, with prices ending up decently under the actual exchange rate for TWD.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">
<a href="https://www.seagm.com/mycard-taiwan-hongkong"><b>SEA Gamer Mall</b></a><br/>SEA GM are decently priced and sell codes specifically for TW and HK regions. Their codes cost slightly above the exchange rate after processing fees with paypal rather than below and still slightly under if you use WebMoney as a payment option. Higher processing fees than OffGamers but should be guaranteed to work.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">
<a href="http://cn-usa.com/?cmd=buy&amp;loc=24285"><b>CN-USA</b></a><br/>
CN-USA are pretty expensive and their storefront is a lot less than smooth to use in general, but their cards are explicitly TW branded and work fine with MHF TW. Not recommended due to the price.</p>

<p class="lessmargin">
Codes purchased on any other similar site will most likely work, but these are the only ones I have personally used on MHF TW.

<div class="backer_tall" id="09sub0">Subscriptions</div>
<p style="margin:0px;"><img style="margin:0px;height:64px;" class="bordered buyingimg" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img2/ISsubscriptions.jpg" alt=""></p>
<div class="backersmall">Basics</div>
<p class="lessmargin">There are a couple of types of subscription available but these can basically be broken down into the Main subscription and Premium Courses.</p>
<p class="lessmargin"><b>Be sure to actually read what you are buying!</b> both the NetCafe Course and the basic 30 Days Core Subscription cost the same!</p>

<div class="backersmall">How Subscriptions Work</div>
<p class="lessmargin">Subscriptions are basically time blocks, if you buy 30 days you will immediately have an expiry date set 30 days later. You can stack these subscriptions without issue. If you bought 30 days of sub and 2 days of premium you would end up with 2 Days of Premium Courses and 32 Days of the Main Subscription, likewise two sets of 30 days would add 60 days to your total subscription time.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">Subscriptions are <b>non-recurring</b>, you must manually buy time each month unless you decide to buy multiple months up front. <b>You do not lose progress if you don't stay subscribed</b>, you simply can't do any content that needs a subscription.</p>


<div class="backer" id="09sub1">Core Subscription</div>
<p class="lessmargin"><img style="margin:0px;height:64px;" class="bordered buyingimg" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./imgZ/coresub.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p class="lessmargin" style="color:red;font-size:110%;margin:-3px 0px 2px;"><b>This is not premium. This is required to play the game proper!</b></p>
<p class="lessmargin">The <b>Main Subscription (30日通行券)</b> is what is needed to play the game proper. It includes the <b>Hunter Life</b> and <b>EX courses</b>.</p>
<p class="lessmargin"><b>Hunter Life</b> gives access to all non-premium quests. This is <b>required</b> to take the vast majority of quests in the game. You will need this to rank up to HR5 and beyond and to participate in events.</p>
<p class="lessmargin"><b>EX course</b> gives you access to all the extra functions in town including town boxes, buying extra items in the store such as Honey, Energy Drinks and Power Seeds and a bunch of Caravan convenience features.</p>
<p class="moremargin">You can't buy a one month subscription and then continue doing HR5+ content after it expires! If you do not have an active subscription you are still restricted to content of HR4 or lower even if you are HR5 or at maxed out G Rank!</p>
<p class="moremargin">This course costs around <b>$9.90 a month</b> with the first month being half price! Exchange rate based on April 2017.</p>


<div class="backer" id="09sub2">Premium Course</div>
<p style="margin:0px;"><img style="margin:0px;height:64px;" class="bordered buyingimg" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./imgZ/prem1day.jpg" alt=""><img style="margin:0px;height:64px;" class="bordered buyingimg" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./imgZ/prem7day.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p class="lessmargin" style="color:red;font-size:110%;margin:-3px 0px 2px;"><b>This is premium and is completely optional!</b></p>
<p class="lessmargin">The <b>Premium Course (1日暢遊券 or 7日狩魂燃燒券)</b> is a single day that includes all of the various Premium Courses from the Japanese version of the game.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">This can be bought as either a <b>single day (1日暢遊券)</b> or as a <b>pack of 7 Days (7日狩魂燃燒券)</b>. The prior option includes 24 hours of each course including the Core Subscription while the latter includes only the VIP parts, with 7 day <b>you will need to already be subscribed to get the most benefits</b>.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">There are a couple of different flavours of <b>Premium or VIP courses</b>, ultimately all are for the same purpose which is to advance through the game's ranks or to get items without needing to invest as much time to do so.</p>

<div class="backersmall">Course Benefits</div>
<div style="width:55%;margin:auto;margin-bottom:10px;">
<ul style="padding: 0px;margin-left:0px;list-style: none;text-align:left;font-size:12px;">

  <li>&bull; Halk Pot Effect (disabled in a few quests)</li>
  <li>&bull; 4x GCP on quests</li>
  <li>&bull; 3x Caravan Points</li>
  <li>&bull; 4x Caravan Gem Colours</li>
  <li>&bull; Always +2 Hiden Materials, +5 on Priority Quests</li>
  <li>&bull; HC rates doubled (5% > 10% on HC, 2% > 4% GHC)</li>
  <li>&bull; Extra carve on everything carvable</li>
  <li>&bull; Most common materials on monsters can be rerolled (see note below)</li>
  <li>&bull; 4 fixed partner carve slots, 4 extra Legendary Pugi carve slots</li>
  <li>&bull; Great Luck effect always active</li>
  <li>&bull; Free Diva Song Buffs at max level (See G Rank section)</li>
  <li>&bull; Legendary Rasta and Pugi</li>
  <li>&bull; 1.25x damage dealt to monsters (disabled in some quests)</li>

  <li>&bull; Halks can only drop Skill Books</li>
  <li>&bull; Access to Premium Quests (mostly outdated)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Premium (and a certain Caravan Gem Skill) makes it so if you carve the most common material on something that can be carved there is a chance to reroll it, this removes the rerolled item from the pool making all the lower % items more common. This is not necessarily always a benefit if you actually <b>want</b> the most common carve but is estimated to be around 10% chance at best.</p>

<div class="backersmall">Legendary Rastas</div>
<p class="lessmargin">Legendary Rastas are powerful AI Companions who are available if you are on a Premium Course, these do not disappear like other AI companions and will actively ignore attacks by monsters and simply infinitely attack them.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">To get a Legendary Rasta to accompany you, simply enter the bar and choose the 3rd option on them followed by confirming your choice. You can only have one Legendary Rasta at each time but can freely swap it with another while you have VIP.</p>
<img class="bordered buyingimg" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img2/partner1.png" alt=""><br/>
<p class="moremargin">After you have them contracted new options will appear to control what items they use on quests (Throwing Knives, Powders, Flutes) and what Weapons they are using.</p>


<div class="backer" id="09sub3">NetCafe Course</div>
<p style="margin:0px;"><img style="margin:0px;height:64px;" class="bordered buyingimg" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./imgZ/netcafe.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The NetCafe Course (1日恩典暢遊券) also known as Super VIP or the Grace Course is an enhanced version of the above premium course. It is mostly identical to the above but it has higher multipliers, comes with a large amount of N Points and gives materials to make special headpieces.</p>

<div class="backersmall">Course Benefits</div>
<div style="width:55%;margin:auto;margin-bottom:10px;">
<ul style="padding: 0px;margin-left:0px;list-style: none;text-align:left;font-size:12px;">
  <li>&bull; All of the standard Premium Benefits</li>
  <li>&bull; PRP/HRP/GRP/SRP/GSRP x5</li>
  <li>&bull; 1,200 N Points</li>
  <li>&bull; NetCafe store items</li>
  <li>&bull; NetCafe Item Booster Set</li>
  <li>&bull; Headpiece Materials</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The item set gives a number of items that are functionally unavailable outside of getting them as a Guild Daily Reward. These include Starving Wolf pots which instantly push you down to 25 Maximum Stamina. It is notable that you can claim these <b>per character slot</b> meaning if you have 3 characters you would get 3 days worth of the items for the day assuming you logged in on all characters to claim them. This is still pretty poor in terms of 'buying items' but is nice as a fre bonus.</p>

<p>The most notable part of this course is the N Points given. Some of the strongest gear is NetCafe equipment that uses thousands of N Points. It is not recommended to buy this course for N Points unless you are very wealthy or it is simply on an event where you get 3,600 N Points instead of 1,200. Typically you will need around 52,000 N Points to make an N Point weapon usable and around 73,600 to get it to Lv49 G Finesse. The final upgrade is generally not worth doing unless you really want to drop the points for marginal DPS as it costs 9,900 alone.</p>
<p>As you might have gathered, these are basically whale weapons.</p>


<div class="backer" id="09sub4">NetCafe Boost Course</div>
<p style="margin:0px;"><img class="notbordered buyingimg" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./imgZ/netcafeboost.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The NetCafe Boost Course (1日恩典增幅暢遊券) also known as Ultra VIP or the Grace Boost Course is a further enhanced version of the NetCafe course. It's mostly the same as the above but comes with additional fixed GRP, more N Points, a crutch skill similar Great Guts and access to two legendary rastas.</p>

<div class="backersmall">Course Benefits</div>
<div style="width:55%;margin:auto;margin-bottom:10px;">
<ul style="padding: 0px;margin-left:0px;list-style: none;text-align:left;font-size:12px;">
  <li>&bull; All of the NetCafe Course Benefits</li>
  <li>&bull; PRP/HRP/GRP/SRP/GSRP x5</li>
  <li>&bull; 3,300 N Points</li>
  <li>&bull; 25,000 fixed GRP on quests</li>
  <li>&bull; Can hire two legendaries</li>
  <li>&bull; Soul Resurgence active</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Like normal NetCafe, the most notable part of this course is the N Points given. It is recommended to only buy this course for N Points while the event where you get 5,700 N Points instead of 3,300 is live.</p>
<p>Soul Resurgence is very similar to a Great Guts Ticket, it can proc once a quest and will save you and recover you to maximum health regardless of what HP you were on when it triggered. This can still fail to save you however on some multihit attacks such as Zinogre's nuke.</p>

A Pugi can be obtained after HR50 from the Pugi farm <b>(see House and AI Companions)</b> and the G Cuffs require you to be GR50 in G Rank and to have purchased a G Cuff License for 60P. In Total you will need to spend 120P to use a G Rank cuff on your pugi.</p>

Premium Pugi Cuffs require the purchase of a Premium Outfit to be used.

If you don't want to wait the required days to get a Pugi and a Departure Facility, buying a <b>G Aid Package</b> will give you 60P which is enough to obtain everything required to use Cuffs and Outfits.

<img class="notbordered buyingimg" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./imgZ/premkits.png" alt=""></p>
<p class="lessmargin">Kits do not include materials to upgrade the equipment they contain. Materials will need to be farmed just as with upgrading any normal set.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">G Rank upgrades require G Tickets which are included in some premium kits and not others. These can be obtained by simply buying them or through exchanging tickets most premkits give on the combiner if you have them.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">The Weapons in Premium Kits are generally only suitable at early G Rank, do not buy a kit expecting to see long term use out of the weapons within! <b>G Rank</b> is still required to craft Premium Kit <b>Tonfas</b>, you cannot pay to use them earlier.</p>

<p class="lessmargin">All <b>Zenith Level</b> premium Weapons and Armour pieces need <b>GR200 Zenith Hypnoc Materials</b>. The material needed is very common and only required in small amounts but still acts as a barrier on maxing pieces until you hit GR200.</p>

<div class="backersmall" style="margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:10px;">Premium Kit Recommendations</div>
<p>Stats on some of these Kits <a href="premkits/index.html" target="_blank">can be found here</a>. This rates them based on the <b>ZP versions of the sets</b>, GP version of Asteli, Carrol and Lien are lacking.</p>
<p>In terms of maximum utility the 10th Anniversary kit outshines literally every other Premium Kit simply by virtue of containing <b>13 sets with relevant meta skills</b>. The pieces from the 10th Anniversary set are actively still used by even high end minmaxing time attack players throughout all of Z2 and likely into Z3 unless there is an unforeseen meta shift.</p>

<p>Some kits are incredibly niche, the Pelegri Headpieces for example are perfectly suited to Gunlancing and Great Sword use but that is their only real use case. The use case for GS is also reduced with Gore pieces and the 10th Anniversary Sets existing. Magisa similarly is only for use on the Hunter's Road as a way to get All Res UP+20 with no real other purpose or niche.</p>

<p class="lessmargin"><img class="notbordered buyingimg" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img2/ISitempacks.jpg" alt=""><br/>
Item Packs or Aid Packages are functionally just packages of consumable items that cost far too much to be a sensible purchase. The exception is the G Aid Package which contains 90P which is enough to immediately get a G Pugi Cuff License at G Rank if you are lacking points (or can be functionally converted to 9,000 GCP if you want to pay for those points).

<div class="backer_tall" id="09i">Lotteries</div>
<div class="backer">Basics</div>
<p class="lessmargin">Lotteries (or Gachapon) are pretty much exactly what you'd expect from the term, you gamble for items using coins. These lotteries can have vastly differing odds but are generally primarily for Armour that is catered to the current meta at the time of release.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">Outside of Armour you can also roll various consumables, weapon materials and N Point items. The consumables include things such as Superior Tickets which allow acccess to incredibly good quests with preset rewards and special G2 pots that fully fill your HP bar. N Point items are incredibly rare on most lotteries but typically are limited to N Blocks, items used to upgrade the first version of a number pieces of NetCafe equipment. Weapons are pretty much globally bad, there are special lotteries for Evolution weapons that are extremely good but they require the same number of Raviente Gems to be maxed as standard ones, meaning hundreds of hours of grind.</p>

<div class="backer">Types of Lottery</div>
<p class="lessmargin"><img class="notbordered buyingimg " src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img2/ISlottery.jpg" alt=""><br/>
<img class="notbordered buyingimg" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img2/ISevangelion.jpg" alt=""><br/>
There are two different types of lottery, Step Up or Lottery G and standard lotteries, these both use same Coins to be rolled for. You can buy various packs of coins ranging from only 1 to 170 coins, this makes the price per coin vary depending on how many you are willing to buy.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">Collaboration Lotteries (Madoka, Evangelion, etc.) always use their own unique types of coins. You cannot buy standard Lottery G Coins and use them to roll for things such as the Evangelion Lotteries. Note that internal capcom collaborations do not have to follow this rule. The Breath of Fire collaboration for example simply used standard coins to be gambled for.</p>

<div class="backer">Using the Coins</div>
<div class="backersmall">Standard Lottery</div>
<p class="lessmargin">The standard lottery coins can only ever be used for their specific lottery, these can be spent by talking to the Lottery Cat in the blacksmith and simply choosing the Standard Lottery option:</p>
<div class="backerarrow">一般抽獎 / Standard Lottery</div>
<p>After selecting your desired lottery you can hit <img src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img/btnsm/square.png" alt="Square"> / <img src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img/btnsm/xbx.png" alt="X"> / Z on keyboard to see the odds of each individual prize. 
</p>

<div class="backersmall">Step Up Lottery</div>
<p class="lessmargin">The Step Up lottery is a bit more complex than the standard lottery, it has a linear step progression that resets each day at 12:00 TW time. Each step gives a different number of lottery rolls and a different type of extra rewards.</p>
<div class="backerarrow">金閃閃STEP UP抽獎 / Lottery Step Up</div>
<div class="backerarrow">活動STEP UP抽獎 / Event Step Up</div>
<div class="backerarrow">臨時倉庫 / Rewards Storage</div>
<div class="backerarrow">新領域點數 / Frontier Points</div>

<p class="lessmargin">After selecting the Step Up lottery you will be brought to the page where you can spend coins to upgrade steps and gamble, each Step's page will display the number of coins used for that step as well as the number of lottery rolls and any extras you will be granted. You can hit <img src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img/btnsm/square.png" alt="Square"> / <img src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img/btnsm/xbx.png" alt="X"> / <b>Z on keyboard</b> to see the odds of each individual prize. 
<br/>
<img class="notbordered buyingimg" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img6/stepupMain.png" alt="">
</p>
<p class="lessmargin">Because the steps reset each day, you will need to put in a lot of coins at once if you want to hit the higher steps. In order to work out the best returns on coins you can check <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ofUIMJgs-St6KfCK66x0keGiu-E6MA_V5ABHP1Alx1Q/edit#gid=590940610">this calculator</a> which automatically presents all rewards and allows for direct comparison of multiple steps vs. doing a single higher step etc.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">Generally speaking going higher than Step 2 will always actively start wasting coins. Doing Step 3 across multiple days is always going to get you more rolls than wasting more coins on higher steps.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">Newer lotteries ocassionally have additional armour type tickets attached to Step 6, if you want this armour it is pretty much the only time it's worth going this high. Do note however that these armours are usually whale fodder and a will cost you between $60 and $200 per finished piece.</p>
<p>After actually gambling you can claim any rewards in the <b>Rewards Storage</b> option, this will have a red exclamation mark if there are items in it.
</p>

<div class="backersmall">Coin Optimisation</div>
<p>Lottery coins are <b>account wide</b> and can be viewed at any time on the Guild Card of any character you have on your account.<br/>
<img class="bordered buyingimg" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./imgZ/lotto.png" alt=""><br/>
If you have multiple Characters on your account, <b>each character has individual Step Up lottery steps</b> you can do every step up to three times without having to wait for a reset. If a lottery is time limited and you have multiple characters it is definitely wise to use them to do multiple of Steps 1 to 2 instead of pushing to Step 6 multiple times. Obviously this requires an initial investment of 200 TWD but is still less than even a month's subscription.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">Without multiple characters on your account the actual best way to save coins is to simply minimise the number of steps you do. You can view the expiration date of most lotteries on the <a href="http://mhfg.capcom.com.tw/payment/kinpikakoban_g/">main lottery page</a> which allows you to work out how much time you have. For example with the typical lottery rolls to coin ratio doing Step 6 will use 80 coins.</p>

<div class="backer">Frontier Points</div>
<p class="lessmargin">Frontier Points are yet another type of point in the game, you get these either by going to higher Steps in a Step Up lottery or by cashing in various tickets for premium equipment.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">It is not advisable to convert the Armour Tickets if you suspect you may ever want to use them, but for the most part the weapons you can gain are poor and thus can be converted without issue. Weapon Tickets are converted into 1FP each and Armour Tickets into 3FP.</p>

<p class="lessmargin">You only need a single ticket to max out any single Exotic piece. This means you need <b>2,500 FP</b> in order to get a full set. Despite how appealing Great Luck might sound the armour pieces are not terribly practical in terms of current skill points. The Rhopessa armour has some niches in status oriented sets (status assault or simply support roles) and the Guild set works well for support oriented sets but has excessive points in some useless skills and will waste slots making it useless for anything optimal.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">Frontier Points appear to have been functionally retired in terms of new equipment, with new Lottery Exotics instead being given out for multiple Step 6 rolls directly.</p>

They're character slots. You can have up to three different characters on a single account and they can all be of different genders. The Post Felyne on the farm can be used to transfer any standard items that go into the normal box between characters but there is no way to transfer equipment. G Rank items require you to be at G Rank to be removed from the box but <b>all decorations including G Rank ones</b> can be extracted without any rank requirement allowing you to be very overpowered while powering through the early ranks.

The lower end is more common with perfect rolls requiring three rolls of 5-20% chance depending on sigil, worse ranges than Sigils from Heavenly Conquests but guaranteed to have rolls only of the types listed on each type.

<div class="backer_tall" id="09npoints0">N Points</div>
<div class="backer">What are N Points?</div>
<p class="lessmargin">N Points are literally NetCafe Points, they are primarily intended as a relief or reward mechanism for players who play inside NetCafes and as such pay for every day of playtime outright.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">These points can be used to buy a good majority of the items in game including HC and GHC carves and a number of N Point exclusive materials for NetCafe gear.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">NetCafe gear is amongst the best in the game as it is intended to be earned over a long period of time in a NetCafe. You get 5 NP a day for taking your daily and the Daily Bonus gives you 200 N Points fixed every month with 15 rolls with a low chance of giving 400 NP extra for the last 15 or so days of a month.</p>
<p>Unlike JP you can outright buy NetCafe course on all platforms which gives 1,200 to 2,400 N Points with events infrequently inflating these amounts to 3,600 and 4,800.</p>

<div class="backer" id="09npoints1">How to obtain</div>
<p>As mentioned, the best way to get N Points is simply to buy NetCafe subscriptions, no other method is reliable and is based on time or RNG.</p>
<p>You get <b>1,200 for each day of the NetCafe Course (1日恩典暢遊券)</b> and <b>2,400 for each day of the NetCafe Boost Course (1日恩典增幅暢遊券)</b>. If there is no event on it is much more sensible to buy the NetCafe Boost course if you are purely wanting N Points as it gives N Points at a rate of 6NP/TWD compared to 4NP/TWD.</p>
<p>If there is a NetCafe Course event on the NetCafe is increased to 3,600 and NetCafe Boost to 4,800. This means they both give the same rate of points and which you buy should be down to how much you want to spend and how much actual NetCafe Course you want to end up with time wise.</p>

<div class="backer" id="09npoints2">What to use on</div>
<p>The best use of N Points is on the various pieces of equipment that are exclusive to it, the weapons are all very powerful and the armour is all good. The issue is of course that the price for most of these is whale territory, if you never intend to get N gear you might want to simply spend the points on G3%s, HCs or GHCs when you need them to save grind.</p>
<table class="centeredtable grankskillstable" style="max-width:370px;min-width:0%;">

</table>

<p>Typically individual armours pieces will cost 6000 NP with a full set being 30,000. Weapons vary quite a lot but they will need up to 835 to be maxed out.</p>
<p>There are often lotteries for the individual N Weapon upgrade materials, specifically the TW exclusive ones and any using the standard N Block materials.</p>
