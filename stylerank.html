<div class="backer" id="11a">Basics</div>
<p>As soon as you hit <b>HR5</b> you can begin Style Rank. Starting it is incredibly trivial and is <b>automatically triggered</b> when you walk towards the <b>Guild Master</b> after simply reaching HR5.<br/>
<img class="bordered" src="img3/npctownGuildmistress.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Style Rank enables a number of effects including special SR Skills, the use of two new movesets per weapon type and access to Hardcore monsters. You can test out the various weapons at the bed in your house to see how their SR movesets work and you can read detailed overviews in the <b>Weapons Section</b> under <b>Detailed Weapon Information</b>.</p>

<div class="backer" id="11e">Weapon Styles</div>

<p>To enable the new movesets use any large box which allows you to change gear (such as the one in the Blacksmith) and go into the section where you would normally choose equipment followed by the newly added final option.<br/>
<b>變更裝備 &gt; 裝備秘傳書</b><br/>
This will bring you to a new menu where you should select your weapon type, followed by the second option and then your preferred style.<br/>
<b>Weapon &gt; 型態 &gt; Style</b><br/>
At HR5 you will have <b>Heaven Style (天之型)</b> and <b>Storm Style (嵐之型)</b> while at this rank the best style for most weapons is Storm Style with some variation. You can swap the style at any time and are not locked to any of the three initially available.</p>
<p>After you reach G Rank you will be able to interact with the Guild Master as above again to unlock <b>Extreme Style (極之型)</b>, this style alters weapons to a huge degree compared to Storm or Heaven styles and is generally always the best in slot style for every weapon class for high level play. You should swap all weapons to this style upon hitting G Rank and unlocking it.</p>

<p>You can find detailed information on each weapon's SR movesets in the <b>Weapons Section</b> under <b>Detailed Weapon Information</b>, the Standard Weapons covers all the normal Mainline weapons and Tonfa and Swaxe each have their own sections as there is simply more to go into for them.</p>


<p class="lessmargin">Your Book of Secrets must be equipped in order to use any alternative movesets, if you somehow disabled it go into the SR menu and choose the first option followed by the first option to toggle it back on.<br/>
<b>變更裝備 &gt; 裝備秘傳書 &gt; Weapon &gt; 裝備秘傳書 &gt; 裝備</b>
</p>
<!--

<p class="lessmargin">
To unlock Storm Style you need to talk to the <b>Guild Master</b> and find the option that gives you your SR urgent.</p>
<p class="lessmargin"><span class="stylerankUrgentdiv3"></span><br/>
<span class="stylerankUrgentdiv2"></span></p>
<p class="lessmargin">
The urgent for any standard weapon's Storm Style will always be hunting a random number of a random HC Monster. Both quantity and monster are rolled for when you first log in.
<br/>
<span class="stylerankUrgentdiv"></span>
<br/>
The Book of Secrets is automatically equipped on you as of MHF-G10 when you enable SR in general (little page icon next to your name in town). This functionally means that the restriction is just 'players below HR5 can't join you'.
<br/>
If you do not feel up to the first option presented to you, simply quit and restart the game to get a new one. You can theoretically do this until you get something incredibly trivial such as hunting Two HC Bulldromes if you have the patience.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">The quests taken for this urgent <b>do not have to be of any specific rank*</b> and as such you can simply hunt the <b>weakest rank of the monster available</b>, as long as you can toggle HC mode on the quest it is valid for the urgent quest, regardless of if it's HR1 or HR5.</p>
<p>After each kill a suitable monster you will hear a jingle and receive a message telling you how many you have left to be killed.</p>
<p class="tinytext"><b>* Tonfas require GSR for their movesets and as such monsters must be GHC rather than HC.</b></p>
-->


<div class="backer" id="11b">Hardcore Monsters</div>
<p class="lessmargin"><b>H</b>ard<b>C</b>ore is a toggleable option for SR quests that transforms the large monsters in the quest into HC monsters. If a quest can be made hardcore it is indicated by a flame icon in the quest list at the top right of its name <img src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img4/hcicon.png" alt="">. <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Flame Icon itself does not mean the quest is HC, you have to actually turn HC mode on!</span></p>
<p class="lessmargin">The HC option itself can be toggled on the final screen after selecting a quest where you confirm player numbers, password etc.:<br/>
<img class="notbordered stylerankimg" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img2/hcquest.png" alt=""></p>
<p class="lessmargin"><b>H</b>ard<b>C</b>ore Monsters are more powerful versions of monsters that have new skills, abilities and looks. Many HC monsters come with a boost to the levels of their Roars, Wind or Quake levels, protection wise this means you will need Super Earplugs, Quake Res +2 and Dragon Wind Breaker.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">Completing a quest that is toggled to HC will grant you SR Weapon Souls (a ticket item visually), these are used in the crafting of some weapons and armour related to the weapon type (see Hiden Sets). If you are using a weapon within the Rarity Limit stated in your Book of Secrets you will gain a multiplier for <i>HRP (3x), SRP (4x), Zeny (1.5x) and GCP (1.5x)</i>, this makes HC quests a very good way of gaining ranks. As of G10 most of these multipliers are irrelevant and instead are only notable for multiplying their equivalent's on your Partner (Partner Rank and Partner Weapon rank.)</p>
<p class="lessmargin">The only difference in a Quest that you have made Hardcore is the monster or monsters themselves. If a quest has multiple large monsters they will all become their Hardcore variants.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">G Rank quests get all the same effects as normal Hunter Rank HC ones, the multipliers are different and obviously apply to G versions of the ranking points and currency (GRP, GSRP, Gzeny).

<div class="backer" id="11carves">Hardcore Carves</div>
<div class="backersmall">Basics</div>
<p>HC Carves are simply an additional type of carve available from HC monsters. Generally speaking, each type of monster will have one HC carve per tier they have (HR1-2, HR3-4, HR5-6, G Rank).</p>
<p>The standard way to get HC Carves is simply from actually killing and carving a monster, but there are a small number of event quests that can reward them as normal rewards. The standard rate for a HC Carve is 5% and the rate for a GHC carve is 2%.</p>
<p>These are used fairly commonly across gear, basically service the role of a low% carve like Gems or Plates in anything added since Hardcore Monsters became a thing.</p>
<p>If you carve an HC Carve you will hear a special jingle distinct from the normal carving success sound. HC carves may be carved by your Partner and will appear in the rewards after a quest (no jingle). While on Premium the Legendary Pugi can also get them in the same manner as your partner.</p>
<p>N Points and Festival Points can also be spent on HC Carves. These will cost around 100 N Points or 500 Festival Points minimum. The Diva Defense event also rarely allows you to buy carves with standard GCP if you have the relevant Prayer active. See the <b>Regular Events</b> section for more details on Festival and Diva Defense.</p> 


<div class="backersmall">Carve Mechanics</div>
<p>HC Carves are unique in that they are <b>outside of the normal carve pool</b>. This means that when you carve a monster you roll first for the pool from which you get an item and then after that the item itself.</p>

<p>For anything that can cause you to reroll carves such as Caravan Gem skills you will roll for the table on the second attempt too. As an example, if you initially carved a Lavasioth Scale and got a reroll you would have 5% chance of the new carve being a HC and 95% of it being either a Shell (73%) or a Fang (27%).</p>



<div class="backer" id="11souls">Weapon Souls</div>
<p>Weapon Souls are a per weapon ticket type that is rewarded for killing any HC monster. Each weapon has 4 different levels of Souls basd on the rank of the monster fought.</p>

<p>Each weapon in Monster Hunter has its own internal multiplier that is applied to its True Raw value, you can divide the displayed attack on a weapon to see their True Raw but every weapon has the same limits based upon your Attack Ceiling level.</p>

<p class="lessmargin">Finally if you had <b>35 levels</b> your ceiling would be <b>3,080 Attack or 2,200 True Raw</b>, as this covers your 3,080 Attack perfectly you would get all of it. Of course if you then used a Power Pill or were affected by a Demon Horn you would suddenly be over your ceiling and would again be losing some of your attack power.</p>

<p class="lessmargin">A good starting number to aim at is around 50 levels, this will cover most skills pre-hiden including being buffed by Hunting Horns and having Adrenaline active. Later game you will want to push much higher and should grind it up to around 190 to cover most use cases with late game skill sets. The <a href="damage/index.html">Damage Calculator</a> automatically calculates your required number of My Missions and Attack Ceiling level based on values and skills you might want to utilise if you want an exact number.</p>

<p>Actually increasing the value of the Attack Ceiling is done by completing My Missions, these are detailed in the next section below.</p>

<div class="backer" id="11mymission"><img style="margin-top:2px;" src="img4/iconSR.png" alt="" class=" b-loaded"> My Mission</div>
<p class="lessmargin">My Mission is a series of objectives that are unlocked after you hit HR6 and unlock Style Rank. There are two types of these missions, the first are the <b>Medal Series</b> that are purely vanity oriented and do not have any notable effects.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">The second series is the <b>Weapon Series</b> which are used to enhance four different skills on all weapon types.</p>

<div class="backersmall" style="margin-top:5px;">Medal Series</div>
<p>The Medal Series are the purely vanity challenges that have an associated Hunter Navigation Task that gives <b>30x My Mission Tickets (挑戰達成證)</b> that allows you to skip the Weapon Series tasks. These tasks can be taken in your house in the SR Display Room which has a bullseye icon next to it, this unlocks at HR5.</p>


<div class="backersmall" style="margin-top:5px;">Weapon Series</div>
<p>As mentioned the Weapon Series are global across all your weapons, you can view your active My Mission by looking at your Book of Secrets (狀態 > 秘傅書狀態). This will display the task number you are on, the target and any progress towards the goal. This progess is saved even if you log out.<br/>
<span class="srMMdiv"></span>
Both the standard Hunter Rank and G Rank quest NPCs have options dedicated towards these missions, selecting it will automatically search for relevant quests that meet the requirements. But you will still <b>need to toggle HC manually if it is required</b> by the mission you are on!</p>

<p>The number of My Missions you should realistically take varies massively depending on your level of progression, the following are some estimates to aim for that give you wiggle room and should cover most skill sets used at that point and most play styles:</p>

<p>Each of the missions given to you can be skipped by using certain items. Specifically you can use <b>My Mission Tickets (挑戰達成證)</b> which are fairly rare naturally or by simply spending lottery coins. You can find the skip option on the Guild Master from who you get SRs and GSRs. Skipping using lottery coins is definitely not recommended.</p>
<p>Days of premium will give you 40 My Mission Tickets and you can trade junk weapon tickets you might get from gambling on the lottery system for them on the combination NPC.</p>


<div class="backer_tall" id="11hiden">Hiden</div>
<div class="backer">Hiden Basics</div>
<p>All weapons in the game have a number of associated Hiden Armours and Decorations. These provide points in their weapon's specific <b>Weapon Tech Skill</b> which is a skill catered specifically to a weapon type. This skill always grants Super High-Grade Earplugs and an attack multiplier of at least 1.2x for Melee and 1.3x for Ranged.</p>
<p>Having one of these skills is commonly referred to as having 'Hiden' for that weapon. Having Hiden means that you have at least 5 decorations for that specific Hiden type. These decorations are made by converting maxed out Hiden Armours into Decorations.</p>
<p>Getting your first Hiden is a very long process involving 775 hunts at minimum that will likely take <b>at least 30+ hours of play with a good set.</b> Do not go into G Rank thinking you should start Hiden Grind, it is very much something to do after you have an established set, starting it too early is incredibly likely to cause burn out! See the <b>G Rank</b> section on a guide on efficient grind that goes more in depth than this section!</p>

<p><b>Hiden Armour</b> granting these technically becomes available at <b>HR6</b> but cannot be finished until GR500, completing one of these sets is one of the big grinds you can expect to undertake mid to late game.</p>
<div class="backer" id="11k">Hiden Grind</div>
<div class="newbox_shadow_red" style="margin-bottom:8px;max-width:83%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;padding:0px;font-size:95%;">
<p style="color:white;margin-bottom:4px;">
<span style="font-size:120%;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:4px;">A proper guide to this guide is in the G Rank section!</span><br>
This section simply details the absolute basics of the grind rather than how to actually do it efficiently!</p>
</div>

<p>Creating Hiden Decorations is a process that lasts until late G rank. You can start working on Hiden Armour from HR5 but you cannot finish it until GR500. Hiden Armour requires multiple HC, GHC and G1% carves and lots of Weapon Souls, Ribbons and Merits gained from hunting HC, GHC and standard G Rank monsters.</p>


<div class="backer">HL Hiden</div>
<p>Simply subscribing after hitting GR500 will give you a set of five tickets that you can convert on the combiner NPC for a full Hiden. This removes one of the biggest grindy elements currently in game and makes getting a proper foundation for endgame zeniths much easier!
<div class="backerarrow300">秘傳珠交換 / HL Hiden Trade</div>
</p>
<p><b>Be sure to read the Choosing Decorations part in the G Rank Section despite the grind removal!</b> you do not want to end up with a bunch of brick decorations because you didn't read a few paragraphs!</p>


<div class="backer">Grind Process</div>
<div class="backersmall">Souls, Ribbons and Merits</div>
<p class="lessmargin">As mentioned above whenever you hunt a HC monster you will gain a Soul for the weapon you used on that quest (e.g. LS on Gou HC grants a Longsword Soul (Top) <b>太刀魂·天</b>), these are used to create the base Hiden sets.</p>

<p class="lessmargin">To fully upgrade a Hiden set however you must also be at <b>G Rank</b> to get <b>Ribbons</b> and then at <b>G Rank 500</b> to start getting <b>Merits</b><br/>
<img src="imgZ/srmaterials.png" alt="" class="notbordered"></p>
<p>Every day at 12:00 a set of monsters are promoted to Priority status, hunting these gives extra Souls, Ribbons or Merits. You will always gain 2 extra and they give an additional 5 if you are premium for a total of 8. These monsters follow a set pattern and a (presumed to be correct) schedule <a href="schedule/index.html">can be found here</a>.<br/>

<div class="backer" id="11i"><img style="margin-top:2px;" src="img/blank.png" data-src="./img4/iconSR.png" alt=""> SR My Mission Stats</div>

<p>At the bottom of the Book of Secrets there are four different stats that do not level naturally, these are those that are levelled up by killing assigned targets from the My Mission system. There are 180 missions total to max out the stats (110 levels in Attack Ceiling, 20 in Damage Reduction, 20 in Partial HP, 20 in Status Recovery. These stats are upgraded <b>per weapon</b> meaning you will need to do 180 missions per weapon type to get the most out of them. <br/>

<span class="bookofsecretsdiv"></span>
<br/>
As of G10 these are no longer per weapon and instead are global across all weapons making it a much smaller scale undertaking.
</p>

<div class="backersmall">Damage Reduction:</div>
<p>
20 Levels. A percentage reduction to all damage taken, 10% at maximum level (0.5% a level).
</p>

<div class="backersmall">Attack Ceiling</div>
<p class="events redevent">It's incredibly easy to hit maximum attack at G Rank. All G Rank players strive to raise this stat!</p>
<p>180 Levels. This is the maximum value for attack <b>as displayed on the guild card</b>. By default the value is 800 true raw which is multiplied based on weapon type. You can see the multipliers and the vanilla max attack in the table below:</p>

</table>

<p>There are 180 levels that each raise this limit by <b>40 true raw</b>. For example doing <b>50</b> missions would increase the base from <b>800 to 2800 true raw</b> allowing <b>3920 Attack with a SnS or DS</b> (2800*1.4).</p>


<p>Everything that <b>increases the attack value on the guild card</b> counts towards this limit, this includes the LS Spirit Bar, the Tonfa combo meters, DS Sharpens, Demon Drugs, Food Buffs, and SR Attack Increase levels. etc.
<br/>Things such as Critical Hits and Weapon Sharpness do not count towards it as they do not modify the value on the guild card.
<br/>You can verify what factors contribute to the Attack Ceiling on the <a href="fist.moe/damage/index.html">Fist.moe Damage Calculator</a>, the leftmost column shows you the level needed and My Missions (below) required to be cleared to attain that level.</p>

<div class="backersmall" style="margin-top:10px;">Partial HP on Hit:</div>
<p>20 Levels. Simply increases the amount of red HP you will have left after you take a hit. Extra HP is simply <b>Lv x 1%</b> extra health.
</p>
<div class="backersmall">Status Recovery:</div>
<p>20 Levels. Reduces the time that statuses affect you by up to 1 second. Time reduction is <b>1.5 x Lv</b> worth of frames, <b>up to 30 frames</b> and therefore <b>1 second</b> at 30fps.

<p>Considering that with G Rank weapons can get True Raw values of over 600 without any skills or additions it's quite obvious to see why these missions are important, for example the G Rank Akantor Great Sword has 2548 Raw without any skills, if you added <b>only Adrenaline+2</b> this would instantly be over 3840 Raw. You should aim to have at least 20 levels in the attack ceiling minimum to cover your bases after starting G. When approaching better sets you should push for higher and eventually around 80 to 100 total.</p> 

<div class="backersmall">The Missions</div>
<p>You can view your active My Mission by looking at your Book of Secrets (狀態 > 秘傅書狀態). This will display the task number you are on, the target and any progress towards the goal.<br/>

<div class="backersmall">Level Recommendations</div>
<p>As mentioned above if you intend to play at anything resembling endgame you should consider these challenges <b>completely compulsary</b>, the game is constantly adding new skills that raise attack making the original 800 True Raw limit more and more irrelevant to G Rank play in general.</p>

<p>To get a <b>precise number</b> on what your level requirements will actually be you can use the <a href="http://fist.moe/damagecalc.html">Fist.moe Damage Calculator</a>, simply enter the skills you'll be using and your weapon values in the left column and look at the calculator's output. If you simply want to estimate enter around 500-600 as base true raw for typical late to endgame numbers.</p>
<p>You can also click the <b>Future Skills</b> button if you want estimates based on the future skills coming.</p>

<div class="backersmall">Vanity Challenges</div>
<p>Upon hitting HR5 and starting Style Rank you will gain access to the SR Self Challenge Room, this room serves as a way to display all the weapons you have SR in as well as the Hiden Sets you have crafted.
<br/><br/>There are two NPCs in this room, <b>R</b> and <b>S</b>.
<br/><b>R</b> gives challenges that grant you medals for completion, they are mostly vanity quests but completing them all will give 30 <b>My Mission Tickets (挑戰達成證)</b> to skip S' stat quests.
<br/><b>S</b> gives challenges similar to R's as well as quests that will improve the stats on your <b>Book of Secrets</b>. These can be taken from <b>SR500</b> and will increase the four stats at the bottom of your Book of Secrets (see below). These quests will also appear on the main Quest Giver NPCs as soon as they are relevant meaning you should never have to actually visit this room for the sake of stats.</p>
<div class="backersmall">NPC Menus</div>
<p>Talking to either S or R produces a menu very similar to the following:<br/>
<span class="srchallengeMenudiv"></span><br/>
<b>Select Challenge</b>: Lets you select one of ten challenges from your currently selected set.<br/>
<b>Change Challenge Set</b>: Allows you to swap the challenges with another set. Each set has its own decorative disc which gets decorations added to it as you complete the challenges.<br/>
<b>SR Stat Mission</b>: Missions to complete in order to rank up the bottom four stats on your Book of Secrets. <b>S</b> and the standard Quest NPCs have this option.<br/>
<b>Manual</b>: Opens the online manual in your browser.<br/>
</p>
<div class="backersmall">Missions and Challenges</div>
<p class="lessmargin">
Both Missions and Challenges produce a menu that's very similar to that of the SR100 Urgent, it will list a target of which you have to kill a certain number.<br/>
<span class="srChallengediv"></span>
<br/>
After taking an SR Stat mission from S you will be asked to skip it using items, this menu can also be accessed using the Guild Master in the main town square this appears as a dialogue option:<br/>
<span class="srchallengeSkipdiv"></span><br/>
You will be asked if you want to use tickets or Lottery G coins to skip it, followed by confirming your choice.</p>
<p class="lessmargin">
Quests are persistent across sessions and will be automatically marked as completed after their goal has been achieved.</p>
